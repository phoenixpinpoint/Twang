## Welcome to Twang

Twang is a project to build a simplified compiled language for robotics programming. 


### The goal

The goal is to create a language that compiles to C. Which then can be compiled to the architecture in which your embeded code will run. This allows us to use pre-existing C compilers that are written for any architecture from x86 to ARM64. Thus the user only has to write in one uniform coding language without having to learn C.
